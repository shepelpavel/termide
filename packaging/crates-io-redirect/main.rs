This `termide` package from crates.io is OBSOLETE and is NOT the TermIDE IDE.

TermIDE is a multi-crate Cargo workspace and is not published to crates.io.
Install the real thing from GitHub instead:

    cargo install --git https://github.com/termide/termide --locked

or download a prebuilt binary / run the installer:

    https://github.com/termide/termide
